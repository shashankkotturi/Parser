# Parser
Basic parser for Assembly Instructions using algorithms with switch statements and enumerated types, and detection of the style of the Assembly Instruction (Eg - Comments, ALU Instructions, Load/Store Instructions)

This project was built on C++. Attached is batch file that can compile the C++ project. However, it can be a hassle to use this compiler.
So please use any other compilers to run this code.
